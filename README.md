# Weather APP

A website that les you know the current weather for your location (if enabled) or for the city you want.

This site is build using Handlebars, SCSS, Javascript, and Node.js.

## Please note

The design is not responsive. I wanted to focus on the back end of the app. 

If you happen to use the app, from time to time you will see a gif of a man "not knowing something".

At the time of the app release, there are still several weather descriptions I do not know. This gif is used as a wildcard. :-)
